# Algorithm Challenge #25 – Lowercase First Letter of Each Word (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program reads a line of text and converts the first letter
of each word to lowercase.

The solution processes the string character by character
and applies in-place transformation for efficiency.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Detecting word boundaries in strings
- Safely modifying strings in place
- Using standard character conversion functions
- Handling edge cases in loop boundaries
- Writing clean and maintainable text-processing logic

---

🧩 Example
-
**Input:**

Enter your text:

Hello World From C++

**Output:**

hello world from c++

💬 Notes
-
This challenge completes a logical progression of string-based problems:
detecting word starts, uppercasing them, and now lowercasing them.

It reinforces careful state management and attention to boundary conditions.
